# Hi, I'm Manuel Pol

I’m a Software Engineer graduated from the **Faculty of Engineering, University of Buenos Aires (FIUBA)**.  
My background covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications of Software Engineering, with a focus on problem-solving and building robust, scalable systems. \
This growing knowledge and skills are substantiated by several projects covering diverse fields of Software Engineering, including:

## 🌐 Distributed Systems  
Understanding of system architectures where components are spread across multiple networked computers. Knowledge in scalability, fault tolerance, and synchronization, essential for large-scale applications.
#### Works
- [GEduNet](https://github.com/MegaRedHand/network-simulator) is an Graphical Educational Computer Network Simulator. It's meant as an aid to students trying to understand computer networks, along with their teachers.
- Horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant [distributed system architecture](https://github.com/pgallino/Distribuidos-TP-Grupal) for large-scale data processing in a multicomputing environment, with inter-node communication via **RabbitMQ**-based message queue middleware.

## 📱 Application & API Development
Proficient in designing and building modern applications and **RESTful APIs**, applying best practices for clean architecture, maintainability, and efficient communication between services.
#### Works
- [ClassConnect](https://github.com/IS2-Class-Connect), a (Google Classroom-like) full-stack educational management application that enables seamless interaction between students and teachers.
- [Reaserch Page](https://github.com/lminervino18/researchers-page-conicet) designed to showcase the work of researchers affiliated with CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Argentina).

## 👨🏻‍💻 Algorithms and Best Practices  
Strong knowledge of algorithm design and analysis, focusing on efficiency and scalability. Committed to applying software development best practices such as clean code, modular design, and maintainability to ensure high-quality solutions.

## 📊 Data Science  
Experience in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling to extract insights from structured and unstructured data. Skilled in using data to drive decisions and support research.  

## 🤖 Machine Learning  
Familiar with algorithms and techniques to build predictive models, automate tasks, and enable systems to learn from data. Hands-on experience with supervised and unsupervised learning.  

## 🛠 Abstract Data Types  
Strong foundations in the design and implementation of abstract data types and data structures, crucial for efficient problem-solving and algorithm development.
